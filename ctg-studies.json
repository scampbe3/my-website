Randomization is 2:1, with 28 in the treatment group and 14 in the sham control group.\n\nA pretreatment visit will occur at or before the time of enrollment; follow-up visits will occur at the clinical site at 3- and 12 months post injection. Target enrollment is 42 subjects. Patients in the control group can crossover to the treatment group after 3-month follow-up. Crossover patients then follow the treatment group follow-up timeline based on their second real treatment. Subjects will complete the study following the 1-year follow-up visit.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to observe the improvement in subject-reported clinical outcomes from baseline to 3 months after 2nd treatment and between groups at 3 months, with continued evaluation of efficacy and durability up to 12 months.

However, the residual nucleus pulposus may protrude again after extraction, and the stability of the operative segment decreases and the degeneration of the diseased segment accelerates. Therefore, while decompression of nerve root is completed under total endoscopic nucleus pulposus extraction, tissue engineering of nucleus pulposus is urgently needed to replace the lost part, repair the remaining nucleus pulposus, and enable the disc to be re-sealed and pressurized. Nucleus pulposus tissue engineering is mainly based on cell therapy, and the corresponding biological scaffolds are selected to transplant cells into the diseased area for treatment. However, the current nuclear tissue engineering has some shortcomings, such as limited seed cell source, difficult survival of seed cells, inflammatory rejection in the transplantation area, poor mechanical properties of biological scaffolds, poor degradation performance, and inability to produce biospecific reactions between materials and cells, which seriously restrict the clinical application of nuclear tissue engineering. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) are ideal seed cells for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation due to their wide availability, strong proliferation ability and good immune regulation. Therefore, in this project, hUC-MSCs are used for cell transplantation into the vertebral disc of diseased vertebrae. As the treatment method of this project is extremely minimally invasive, it is conducive to the widespread promotion of the technology.","detailedDescription":"In order to initially observe the safety and effectiveness of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) transplantation in the treatment of lumbar disc degeneration, this project planned to include a single group of 20 patients with lumbar disc herniation, and adopt an open study design of non-random, self-controlled, single-dose group, and locally inject 2mL hUcMSCs into the lumbar disc of enrolled patients.\n\nThe patients were followed up 3, 6 and 12 months after injection to evaluate the safety of hUC-MSCs. Meanwhile, the improvement of patients' low back pain and quality of life were evaluated. Lumbar MRI is used to evaluate the improvement of patients' lumbar disc signal, proving that hUC-MSCs transplantation can delay lumbar disc degeneration and treat lumbar degenerative diseases."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lumbar Disc Degeneration"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"non-randomized, self-controlled, single-dose","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"hUC-MSCs transplantation group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells","interventionNames":["Biological: human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell suspension"]},{"label":"control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"suspension transplantation","interventionNames":["Procedure: total endoscopic extraction of lumbar nucleus pulposus"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell suspension","description":"2 \\* 10\\^7 cells (2ml)","armGroupLabels":["hUC-MSCs transplantation group"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"total endoscopic extraction of lumbar nucleus pulposus","description":"hUC-MSCs are injected into the opposite side of the minimally invasive surgical site immediately after surgery, and the puncture needle remains for 1 minute after injection and then pull out to prevent cell suspension leakage","armGroupLabels":["control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of lumbar disc MRI (T2WI) signal values","description":"Lumbar MRI images are taken on day 0-1 (measured before stem cell transplantation), 3 months, 6 months and 12 months to record the signal value of the intervertebral disc (4 times in total) from level IV-V to level III and below.","timeFrame":"12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Lower back pain and lower extremity radiating pain relief","description":"VAS scores of low back pain and lower extremity radiative pain are recorded on day 0-1 (measured before stem cell transplantation), 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months (4 times in total) from score 4-10 to score 3 and below.","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"X-ray Disc Height Index (DHI)","description":"On day 0-1 (measured before stem cell transplantation), 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months, the patients take anterior and lateral lumbar X-rays and record the DHI value (4 times in total) to reach the outcome of DHI≤0.188.","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"MRI highlights changes in the size of the nucleus pulposus","description":"On day 0-1 (measured before stem cell transplantation), 3 months, 6 months and 12 months, lumbar MRI is taken to measure the size of the protruded nucleus pulposus and record (4 times in total) to reach the outcome of size between 0.7cm×0.5cm×0.5cm and 2.4cm×2.0cm×1.5cm.","timeFrame":"12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

ACDF was performed with stand-alone interbody fusion device and artificial bone graft (hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate). Patients have 1-level or 2-level cervical degenerative disc disease approved for ACDF surgery by National Health Insurance, which is the blind, third-party, administrative approved and insurance reimbursement for surgical indication. Total 180 patients were enrolled, and 180 patients were randomized into either investigational device (non-rigid) group or the control (rigid) group in a 2:1 ratio. After confirming a patient's eligibility and having the patient sign an informed consent form, the site investigator or study coordinator call the coordinator at National Taiwan University Hospital for the randomization. Each patient will be then assigned to 1 of the treatment group according to a randomized schedule. Patient were evaluated preoperatively, one month postoperatively, and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postoperatively. Measured outcomes included overall success, Neck Disability Index (NDI), VAS neck and arm pain, adjacent range of motion, patient satisfaction, anxiety score, SF-12 MCS/PCS, major complications, subsequent surgery rate, and subsidence and fusion rate on radiological examinations. The primary endpoint was a FDA composite definition of success comprising clinical improvement and absence of major complications and secondary surgery events."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cervical Disc Degeneration"],"keywords":["Cervical Spine","Interbody Fusion","Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Total 180 patients were enrolled, and 180 patients were randomized into either investigational device (non-rigid) group or the control (rigid) group in a 2:1 ratio.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":180,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Investigational device (non-rigid) group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Use non-rigid (Titanium Alloy, Z-Brace, Baui Biotech) interbody fusion device.","interventionNames":["Combination Product: Z-Brace interbody fusion device"]},{"label":"Control device (rigid) group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Use rigid (PEEK) interbody fusion device .","interventionNames":["Combination Product: PEEK interbody fusion device"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"COMBINATION_PRODUCT","name":"Z-Brace interbody fusion device","description":"Use non-rigid (Titanium Alloy, Z-Brace, Baui Biotech) interbody fusion device in Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF) surgery","armGroupLabels":["Investigational device (non-rigid) group"]},{"type":"COMBINATION_PRODUCT","name":"PEEK interbody fusion device","description":"Use rigid (PEEK) interbody fusion device in Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF) surgery","armGroupLabels":["Control device (rigid) group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from baseline postoperative condition (if patients have major complications)","description":"No adverse events (AEs) classified as major complications by Research Ethics Committee.","timeFrame":"Patient were evaluated one month postoperatively, and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postoperatively."},{"measure":"Change from baseline postoperative condition (if patients have subsequent surgeries)","description":"No subsequent surgical intervention.","timeFrame":"Patient were evaluated one month postoperatively, and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postoperatively."},{"measure":"Change from baseline Subsidence and Fusion rate","description":"Subsidence and fusion rate on radiological.","timeFrame":"Patient were evaluated one month postoperatively, and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postoperatively."},{"measure":"Change from baseline Adjacent range of motion","description":"Adjacent range of motion on radiological.","timeFrame":"Patient were evaluated preoperatively, one month postoperatively, and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postoperatively."},{"measure":"Change from baseline Neck Disability Index (NDI)","description":"An improvement in Neck Disability Index (NDI) score of at least 30 points for a patient with a preoperative NDI score of 60 or greater; or an improvement of at least 50% of preoperative NDI score for patients with a preoperative score of less than 60.","timeFrame":"Patient were evaluated preoperatively, one month postoperatively, and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postoperatively."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Visual analogue scale (neck and arm and chest pain)","description":"Patient will be evaluated by Visual analogue scale(VAS) for their neck, arm and chest pain.\n\nThe minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 10.

Back pain is the number one cause of disability in the US, and the spine is the most common location of chronic pain in Veterans. Physical therapy is often very effective at improving patients' back pain, but it does not work for everyone, and it is not understood how physical therapy alters the tissues within the spine. With this research the investigators hope to learn if the investigative team can measure changes to the spinal discs on MRI scans that might predict if a patient's back pain will improve with physical therapy or not.","detailedDescription":"Low back pain, which is frequently associated with intervertebral disc degeneration, is the most common cause of adult disability in the United States. Among active service members, the incidence of disc degeneration more than doubled from 2001 to 2010, with over 68,000 days of lost duty time attributed to disc degeneration.2 The most common location of chronic pain in Veterans is the spine. The incidence of back pain in the general public has remained relatively stable over the past decade, however, there has been more than a 50% increase in the number of Veterans diagnosed with back pain. The intervertebral discs are the largest avascular structures in the body, and therefore cells within the disc rely on transport from the small vessels in the adjacent vertebral endplate to receive nutrients and expel waste products. Despite the immense social and economic burden of back pain, the etiology of disc degeneration remains poorly understood. Because of the avascular nature of the disc, it has been speculated that poor disc nutrition characterized by reduced trans-endplate transport into the disc could contribute to the initiation and progression of degeneration. If a reduction in trans-endplate transport of nutrients and waste products is a primary contributor to the initiation and progression of the degenerative cascade, then enhancing disc nutrition may have a therapeutic effect. Physical therapy and exercise can be very effective in managing back pain for certain patients, yet it is not fully understood why certain patients respond to physical therapy and others do not, and what effects such interventions have on disc nutrition and disc health. The goal of this study is to undertake a pilot study to determine the feasibility and preliminary outcomes of utilizing quantitative MRI in human patients to quantify changes in disc health and trans-endplate transport over the course of physical therapy.\n\nTo do so, patients with low back pain and concomitant disc degeneration, who have not had prior spinal surgery, will be recruited. Recruited patients will undergo MRI T2-mapping and post-contrast enhanced T1-mapping of their lumbar spines at 1.5T to measure disc health and nutrition, respectively. Patients will then begin a 6 week physical therapy treatment regimen, after which the same MRI scans will be performed again on each patient. Pain and disability level of patients will be assessed via the visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaires, both pre- and post-treatment. Lumbar active range of motion will also be quantified at the initial and final in-office physical therapy session. Inclinometers will be placed at the thoracolumbar junction and sacrum, and the patient asked to bend forward and backward. Lumbar flexion will be quantified as the difference in motion between the two inclinometers.\n\nSignificant differences T1 and T2 values in the disc, as well as VAS and ODI scores and lumbar range of motion, before and after physical therapy will be assessed via a paired t-test, with significance defined as p\\<0.05. Univariate linear correlations between the changes in T1 or T2 values and changes in VAS, ODI scores and lumbar range of motion will be performed to determine if altered disc health or nutrition with physical therapy is significantly correlated with improvements in pain and disability."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Back Pain","Intervertebral Disc Degeneration"],"keywords":["spine","intervertebral disc","physical therapy","imaging"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Physical therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects will be prescribed a 6-week physical therapy regimen consisting of one 45 minute in office visit per week, and home exercises performed daily.

RECK is an acronym which stands for Ropivacaine, Epinephrine, Clonidine, and Ketorolac. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of RECK local injectable anesthetic in the setting of posterior spinal fusion. Our specific aims are the following.\n\nPrimary aim: to investigate the effect of RECK local injectable anesthetic on postoperative VAS pain scores.\n\nSecondary aims: to investigate of effect of RECK injection on postoperative opioid consumption and hospital length of stay.\n\nHypothesis: RECK injection will significantly decrease postoperative VAS pain score, opioid consumption, and hospital length of stay compared to placebo controls.","detailedDescription":"Patients will be randomized into two groups. Intraoperatively, they will be given either 1) a 50 mL RECK (ropivacaine, epinephrine, clonidine, and ketorolac) cocktail containing 123 mg ropivacaine, 0.25 mg epinephrine, 0.04 mg clonidine, and 15 mg ketorolac into the paraspinal musculature and subdermal space surrounding the operative site once the fascia is closed (intervention group), or 2) a 50 mL injection of saline (control group). RECK is used for pain control and will be administered by fellowship-trained orthopaedic spine surgeons. All patients will have a patient-controlled analgesia pump initiated shortly after surgery, with routine postoperative care and observation from nurses, pain management, and orthopedic surgeons and residents."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Degenerative Lumbar Spinal Stenosis","Degenerative Disc Disease","Degenerative Spondylolisthesis","Degenerative Disease"],"keywords":["Spine Surgery","Lumbar Fusion","Pain Control","Opioid Utilization","Local Anesthesia","RECK","R.E.C.K.","Ropivacaine","Epinephrine","Clonidine","Ketorolac","Randomized Controlled Trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized controlled trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"Double-blinded by investigational drug service","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":72,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention (RECK)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The arm of patients who will be administered \"RECK\" local anesthesia cocktail:\n\nRopivacaine 0.125g Clonidine 80 mcg Epinephrine 0.5 mg Ketorolac 30 mg In sterile water 73 mL (total volume of compound is 100 mL)\n\nGiven through paraspinal muscle injection once intraoperatively.","interventionNames":["Drug: Ropivacaine, Epinephrine, Clonidine, and Ketorolac Injection Cocktail"]},{"label":"Control Group (Placebo)","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"The arm of patients who will be administered a placebo injection:\n\n100 mL Normal Saline\n\nGiven through paraspinal muscle injection once intraoperatively.","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Ropivacaine, Epinephrine, Clonidine, and Ketorolac Injection Cocktail","description":"Please refer to description for interventional group.","armGroupLabels":["Intervention (RECK)"],"otherNames":["RECK"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo","description":"100mL paraspinal normal saline injection intraoperatively, once.","armGroupLabels":["Control Group (Placebo)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Postoperative VAS Pain Scores","description":"Primary aim: to investigate the effect of RECK local injectable anesthetic on postoperative VAS pain scores.\n\nVAS (Visual Analogue Scale) measures pain intensity.

It occurs in approximately 80% of the population throughout their lives. Most low back pain is associated with intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) associated with neuroinflammation and pain. In this context, the study of sphingolipid metabolism can play an important role in the identification of new molecules responsible for the degenerative process. Sphingolipids, in fact, are a class of molecules that are implicated in multiple signal pathways, such as proliferation, degradation of the extracellular matrix, inflammatory state, apoptosis and migration. In particular, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), an intermediate of sphingolipid metabolism, acts as a pro-inflammatory mediator, predominantly in the extracellular environment, regulating important cellular properties related to inflammatory potential and pain. The objective of this study is to characterize the degenerative process in cells isolated from degenerated human intervertebral discs from both at cellular and molecular levels in order to identify new targets implicated in degenerative processes, including sphingolipid signaling pathway.","detailedDescription":"Low back pain (LBP) is a serious public health problem and has been identified as the most widespread cause of disability worldwide by the 2013 Global Burden of Disease Study. It is estimated that in the Western world the annual incidence of acute low back pain is 5% in adults and that the lifetime prevalence is 80%. Although different anatomical structures can be implicated in the generation of LBP, in many cases this is associated with the degeneration of the intervertebral disc (IVD). IVD degeneration (IDD) represents a chronic age-related process, characterized by a progressive reduction in the content of proteoglycans and water in the nucleus pulposus (NP) with the subsequent loss of the ability of the disc to respond to compressive forces with the possible appearance of instability. Furthermore, this degenerative process is accompanied by the development of a highly inflammatory microenvironment which contributes to exacerbating the degenerative process, leading to the progressive structural failure of the disc itself and in most cases, to pain. From these premises, arises the need to better investigate all the cell-mediated mechanisms underlying IDD, to identify and develop new therapies aimed at recovering the IVD and reducing pain.\n\nIn this context, sphingolipids, a class of molecules responsible for multiple signal pathways such as proliferation, migration, apoptosis and angiogenesis, appear to play a key role in exacerbating the inflammatory process and degradation of the extracellular matrix in conditions of IDD. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is an intermediate of sphingolipid metabolism, formed from sphingosine through the action of sphingosine kinases (SphK1, SphK2). Increasing evidence suggests that S1P acts as a pro-inflammatory signal, predominantly in the extracellular environment, regulating important cellular properties correlated with the inflammatory potential on chondrocyte-like cells. It has been reported that an alteration in the production and secretion of these molecules is capable of increasing the inflammatory and degenerative condition in various pathologies related to neuroinflammation and pain. The aim of the project is to define new disease biomarkers and characterize the degenerative process in cells isolated from degenerated human intervertebral discs from both at cellular and molecular levels in order to identify new targets implicated in degenerative processes, including sphingolipid signaling pathway. Secondary objective is the analysis of the effectiveness of the modulation of sphingolipid metabolism and the in vitro testing of molecules with therapeutic potential.\n\nA greater understanding of the events implicated in the pathogenesis of IDD both at macroscopic and microscopic levels, is of fundamental importance for the development of new diagnostic tools, to be combined with current therapeutic strategies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intervertebral Disc Degeneration","Discogenic Pain","Discogenic Disease"],"keywords":["intervertebral disc degeneration","discogenic pain","biomarkers","neuroinflammation","iperinnervation","sphingolipids","sphingosine-1 phosphate"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"cells from human intervertebral disc"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":160,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"cell isolation from intervertebral disc tissue and biomarker investigation","description":"metabolomic, cellular and molecular analysis on intervertebral disc derived cells and investigation of tissue neuroinflammatory and pain-related biomarkers"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Characterization of degenerated intervertebral disc cells","description":"Determination of a panel of inflammatory and degenerated markers related to components of the extracellular matrix and mediators linked to inflammatory/degenerative processes, hyperinnervation and sphingolipid metabolism.","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 3 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Development of cellular model platform","description":"Creation of a cellular platform based on patient-derived intervertebral disc cells;

In addition to age, there are other factors, such as excessive or uneven mechanical load, obesity, genetics, nutrition, trauma and gender. In addition, it is not clear whether the heavy physical load associated with occupation is an important risk factor for IDD. Some studies have found that IDD is more common among athletes than the general population. Due to the complexity and multifactorial nature of IDD, its pathogenesis and risk factors are still unclear, which seriously hinders the rational stratification of LBP patients and limits the development of personalized treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cytokine","Intervertebral Disc, Degenerative"],"keywords":["cytokine","chemokine","Intervertebral Disc Degeneration"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"pirffmann 2 grade","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: CXCL2/CXCL8"]},{"label":"pirffmann 3 grade","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: CXCL2/CXCL8"]},{"label":"pirffmann 4 grade","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: CXCL2/CXCL8"]},{"label":"pirffmann 5 grade","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: CXCL2/CXCL8"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"CXCL2/CXCL8","description":"Detecte CXCL2/8 content in nucleus pulposus and peripheral blood of patients in each group","armGroupLabels":["pirffmann 2 grade","pirffmann 3 grade","pirffmann 4 grade","pirffmann 5 grade"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"CXCL2/8 content","description":"CXCL2/CXCL8 content of nucleus pulposus","timeFrame":"1 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* It meets the diagnostic criteria of lumbar disc degeneration; No previous history of spinal surgery; Good ability of independent behavior and cooperation in completing research; The patient is aware of this study and has signed the consent form.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with spinal tumor, infection, tuberculosis and other diseases; Patients with claustrophobia; Parkinson's syndrome patients; Poor cooperation, Poor image quality; Patients with osteoporosis.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with lumbar disc herniation who went to the spinal surgery department of Zhongda Hospital","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Zhongda Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Nanjing","state":"Jiangsu","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"Lei liu, Dr","role":"CONTACT","phone":"18934544893","email":"18934544893@163.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":32.06167,"lon":118.77778}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-11-08"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D055959","term":"Intervertebral Disc Degeneration"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D013122","term":"Spinal Diseases"},{"id":"D001847","term":"Bone Diseases"},{"id":"D009140","term":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M28405","name":"Intervertebral Disc Degeneration","asFound":"Intervertebral Disc Degeneration","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M15919","name":"Spinal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5126","name":"Bone Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12097","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false},

The aim of the study is to evaluate the skeleton in 10 year increments to determine an understanding of the normal skeleton as a person ages. By using x-ray analysis, a new low dose x-ray system (EOS) can be used to evaluate the whole body to see changes in the bone structure over time. Subjects will be asked to undertake one x-ray analysis of their whole body skeletal structure. There will be 25 male and 25 female subjects per decade. The averaging of the measured skeletal parameters will provide information on changes over time generating a standardized expectation of general changes in skeletal structure as participants age.","detailedDescription":"Current techniques of advanced spinal surgery allow physicians to correct complex spinal deformity to nearly any alignment desired. The investigators ability to analyze spino-pelvic alignment has evolved concurrently; however, the investigators goals in deformity correction are still not completely understood. With increasing ability to assess whole body alignment, the investigators must establish a baseline for the \"normal\" population inclusive of age related changes. the investigators hypothesis is that global body alignment will vary based on sex and progressively vary with age.\n\nThe goal of this study is to create an open access database of \"normal\" volunteer full body radiographic images obtained using the new EOS biplanar x-ray imaging system. The system provides a radiographic view of the weight-bearing skeleton equivalent to plain radiography. The development of an open access database of full body images and global spine parameters will provide spine surgeons with normative data that can be used to guide clinical decision making and surgical planning. Furthermore, the database can be used by researchers to obtain control measurements for comparison in studies of various spine, and potentially non-spine, pathologies.\n\nSpecific Aims\n\n1. To create an open access database of radiographic full body images in the sagittal and coronal planes of subjectswithout spine deformities or acute or severe chronic disease, across a range of age groups from 20 to 80 year old males and females.\n2.

Patients requiring posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) for lumbar degenerative disease are prospectively enrolled and followed. Important adjacent pre-existing degeneration factors include discs degenerated, facets and ligamentum flavum tropism which could lead to spinal canal stenosis (SCS). This study will focus on the effects of pre- existing adjacent degeneration (disc factors and spinal canal stenosis factors) on long-term postoperative outcomes.","detailedDescription":"Adjacent segment pathologies (ASP), including radiological adjacent segment degeneration (ASDeg) and adjacent segment disease (ASDis) after lumbar fusion surgeries have been troubling complications. The development of ASDis greatly reduces postoperative quality of life, and revision surgery may be required in severe cases. Several risk factors for ASP have been reported, such as age, sex, pre-existing adjacent degeneration, multilevel fusions, sagittal imbalance, the type of fusion, facet tropism and laminar inclination. Because multi-level degenerative imaging is common in lumbar degenerative disease, pre-existing adjacent degeneration makes challenge for the surgery strategy, sometimes it is difficult to determine the level at which fusion ends. Important pre-existing adjacent degeneration factors included discs degenerated, facets and ligamentum flavum tropism which could lead to spinal canal stenosis (SCS). Few studies have focused on asymptomatic pre-existing SCS as a risk factor for ASDis that requires additional surgery at an adjacent segment. But these studies only used the sagittal diameter or ratio to evaluate the degree of adjacent SCS. The status of neural tissues in the canal was neglected. Few studies also have focused on asymptomatic pre-existing degenerated disc as a risk factor for ASDeg. But these studies only used Pfirrmann grade to evaluate the degenerated disc. High-intensity zone (Hiz), vacuum sign were neglected.\n\nThis prospective study was limited to patients with the same preoperative pathology, the same fusion segments (L4-5 and L5-S1), the same fusion technique (PLIF). Dynamic X-ray and MRI examinations of lumbar will be completed to evaluate the imaging manifestations of the responsible and adjacent segments before surgery. The T2-weighted sagittal and axial MRI images are studied and the following parameters are recorded: grade of cerebrospinal fluid occlusion in L3/4 spinal canal at disc level, and the narrowest axial plane was used for grading; L3/4 disc degeneration by Pfirrmann grade; high-intensity zone (Hiz) and vacuum sign of L3/4 disc; L3/4 disc herniation quantificationally measured by MSU Classification; Patients will be divided into three groups according to the pre-existing status of L3/4 segment. Patients without pre-existing degeneration at L3/4 segment will be classified into control group (NS group). Patients with pre-existing disc factors (Pfirrmann grade≥3, Hiz or vacuum sign) at L3/4 segment will be classified into group D. Patients with pre-existing canal stenosis factors (cerebrospinal fluid occlusion≥1) at L3/4 segment will be classified into group C.\n\nThe patient's age, gender, preoperative body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiologists classification of anesthesia (ASA grade) will be recorded during the hospital stay. Surgical data including operation time, blood loss, perioperative complications (including cerebrospinal fluid leakage, wound infection, postoperative neurological dysfunction, and perioperative secondary surgery, cardiopulmonary complication, cerebral infarction/hemorrhage, etc.), and length of hospital stay are also recorded. Preoperative clinical function questionnaires, including visual analog scale (VAS) of low back, VAS of the legs, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores for patients were completed on admission for surgery without any assistance. All the patients enrolled will finished the follow-up from date of surgery at 1,2 and 5 years. The clinical outcomes and ASP will be recorded."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Degenerative Lumbar Spinal Stenosis","Degenerative Disc Disease","Degeneration Spine"],"keywords":["Cerebrospinal fluid occlusion","Pre-existing degeneration","Spinal canal stenosis","Adjacent segment degeneration","Adjacent segment disease","High-intensity zone","Vacuum sign"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":210,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"NS Group","description":"Patients without pre-existing degeneration at L3/4 segment will be classified into control group (NS group)."},{"label":"D Group","description":"Patients with pre-existing disc factors (Pfirrmann grade≥3, Hiz or vacuum sign) at L3/4 segment will be classified into group D.","interventionNames":["Other: Pre-existing degenerative factors at adjacent segment"]},{"label":"C Group","description":"Patients with pre-existing canal stenosis factors (cerebrospinal fluid occlusion≥1) at L3/4 segment will be classified into group C.","interventionNames":["Other: Pre-existing degenerative factors at adjacent segment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Pre-existing degenerative factors at adjacent segment","description":"Pre-existing degenerative factors at adjacent segment, including disc factors and canal stenosis factors","armGroupLabels":["C Group","D Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Adjacent segment degeneration (ASDeg)","description":"ASDeg is defined as follows according to manifestations on X-rays and MRI changing from baseline : (1) Progression ≥1 grade in SCS or L3/4 disc degeneration;

Patients requiring posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) for degenerative disease are prospectively enrolled and followed. Patients enrolled in this study have asymptomatic pre-existing spinal canal stenosis at adjacent segment. This study will focus on the effects of preventative limited decompression at adjacent segment.","detailedDescription":"Adjacent segment pathologies (ASP), including radiological adjacent segment degeneration (ASDeg) and adjacent segment disease (ASDis) after lumbar fusion surgeries have been troubling complications. The development of ASDis greatly reduces postoperative quality of life, and revision surgery may be required in severe cases. Several risk factors for ASP have been reported, such as age, sex, pre-existing adjacent degeneration, multilevel fusions, sagittal imbalance, the type of fusion, facet tropism and laminar inclination. Previous studies have reported asymptomatic pre-existing spinal canal stenosis (SCS) as a risk factor for ASDis that requires additional surgery. Appropriate strategy needs to be explored for the treatment of asymptomatic pre-existing spinal canal stenosis.\n\nLimited decompressions, including partial laminotomy and flavectomy, have been proved to have the role of enlargement in spinal canal. Therefore, we hypothesize that limited decompressions at adjacent segment with asymptomatic pre-existing SCS will have the preventive effect on ASP.\n\nThis prospective study will be limited to patients with the same preoperative pathology, the same fusion segments (L4-5 and L5-S1), the same fusion technique (PLIF). Dynamic X-ray and MRI examinations of lumbar will be completed to evaluate the imaging manifestations of the responsible and adjacent segments before surgery. Patients with asymptomatic pre-existing canal stenosis factors (cerebrospinal fluid occlusion grade 1) at L3/4 segment will be enrolled. Patients will be randomly divided into two groups according to different strategies. NS Group includes patients who simply receive responsible segments fused (L4-S1). LD Group includes patients who receive responsible segments fused (L4-S1) plus limited decompression at adjacent segment (L3/4). In terms of limited decompression at the adjacent segment, partial laminotomy, flavectomy, and bilateral medial facetectomies up to the pedicle will be performed. Complete laminectomy and destroy of posterior ligament complex will be avoided.\n\nThe patient's age, gender, preoperative body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiologists classification of anesthesia (ASA grade) will be recorded during the hospital stay. Surgical data including operation time, blood loss, perioperative complications (including cerebrospinal fluid leakage, wound infection, postoperative neurological dysfunction, and perioperative secondary surgery, cardiopulmonary complication, cerebral infarction/hemorrhage, etc.), and length of hospital stay are also recorded. Preoperative clinical function questionnaires, including visual analog scale (VAS) of low back, VAS of the legs, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores for patients were completed on admission for surgery without any assistance. All the patients enrolled will finished the follow-up from date of surgery at 1,2, 5 and 10 years. The clinical outcomes and ASP will be recorded."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Degenerative Lumbar Spinal Stenosis","Degenerative Disc Disease","Degeneration Spine"],"keywords":["Adjacent segment degeneration","Adjacent segment disease","Pre-existing degeneration","Limited decompression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"NS Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"NS Group includes patients who simply receive responsible segments fused (L4-S1).","interventionNames":["Procedure: Responsible segments fused"]},{"label":"LD Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"LD Group includes patients who receive responsible segments fused (L4-S1) plus limited decompression at adjacent segment (L3/4).","interventionNames":["Procedure: Limited decompressions at adjacent segment with asymptomatic pre-existing spinal canal stenosis","Procedure: Responsible segments fused"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Limited decompressions at adjacent segment with asymptomatic pre-existing spinal canal stenosis","description":"In terms of limited decompression at the adjacent segment, partial laminotomy, flavectomy, and bilateral medial facetectomies up to the pedicle will be performed.

It can be defined by specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, with a strong correlation between pain and the inflammatory aspect of the disc, resulting in active disc disease (AD). The Modic classification based on MRI of the lumbar spine is considered a reference.\n\nThe management of low back pain in patients with inflammatory disc disease generally involves intra-disc corticosteroid infiltration, which has been widely proven to be effective in reducing pain \\[4-6\\]. However, this procedure can be painful and invasive and sometimes impossible to perform due to severe disc impingement.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy on pain of para-disc infiltration of corticosteroids in contact with the inflammatory MRI signal abnormality (Modic 1) when it is lateralized.\n\nThis variant of infiltration is easier to perform (no catheterisation of the disc and therefore quicker), would entail less risk of disc infection and would be accessible to more radiologists.\n\nIt is already practised but, to our knowledge, has never been the subject of a study to evaluate its effectiveness on pain.\n\nIf successful, more patients could be treated and the range of treatment could be extended."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Degenerative Disc Disease","Inflammation","Low Back Pain"],"keywords":["Low back pain","Injections","Degenerative Disc Disease","Inflammation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Para-discal infiltration","type":"OTHER","description":"Single arm study","interventionNames":["Procedure: Para-discal injection of corticoid"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Para-discal injection of corticoid","description":"In this pilot study, all patients underwent the same procedure: a corticosteroid infiltration via a para-discal approach.

However, medical advancement in this field has allowed for a new procedure often referred to as cervical arthroplasty that implements artificial disc implantation. These implants mimic the function and structure of discs by cushioning the neck's vertebral bones instead of fusing them and providing flexibility for head movements. The emergence of different artificial disc implants that are structurally and mechanistically different calls for a comparative analysis that evaluates performance across a comprehensive set of patient outcomes.\n\nThis study will comprehensively evaluate the outcomes and endpoints of these two different FDA-approved artificial disc implants used to treat cervical spondylotic myelopathy and/or radiculopathy today: Biomet Zimmer Mobi-C and Nuvasive Simplify. Both implants are structurally different with the Nuvasive Simplify implementing a three-piece design with two endplates and a semi-constrained mobile core while the Biomet Zimmer Mobi-C implements an unconstrained three piece design.

Thus, the duration of participation in the study will be approximately one and a half years.\n\nThis study has significant implications in better assessing the overall efficacy of cervical arthroplasty while providing insight to the differences in outcomes based on the artificial disc implanted. Findings can also contribute to characterizing the advantages and disadvantages of both implants to aid surgeons in making more informed and personalized treatment recommendations according to the needs of the patient."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cervical Spondylosis With Myelopathy","Cervical Radiculopathy","Cervical Disc Herniation","Degenerative Disc Disease"],"keywords":["cervical","spondylosis","myelopathy","radiculopathy","disc","cervical disc","artificial disc","artificial disc implantation","cervical arthroplasty","disc herniation","degenerative disc disease","ACDF","Biomet Zimmer Mobi-C","Nuvasive Simplify"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Semi-Constrained Nuvasive Simplify","description":"This group will be undergoing cervical arthroplasty with the Nuvasive Simplify artificial disc implant.

Patient satisfaction, as well as the avoidance of possible complications, are the main focus here. In addition, CE-certified medical devices must be evaluated for long-term performance and safety in clinical practice in accordance with the Medical Devices Act. The VERTICALE® Cervical System is a rod-screw system for immobilization (= immobilization) and stabilization of the affected segments, in the area between the occiput, the cervical spine and the upper thoracic spine (up to the 3rd thoracic vertebral body). Surgical intervention with the VERTICALE® Cervical System is performed from behind (posteriorly) and usually serves to stiffen the affected areas.\n\nThe goals of surgical intervention depend on the exact clinical picture and the associated symptoms, but usually consist of surgical relief of the affected structures of the nervous apparatus and/or spinal cord, stabilization of the bony structures to restore and/or maintain function, and relief of pain."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD)","Instabilities","Trauma","Deformity"],"keywords":["NDI"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"VERTICALE® Cervical System","description":"All measures and devices mentioned in the study protocol correspond to routine clinical practice with the exception of the following questionnaires:\n\nNDI (Neck Disability Index) NRS (Numerical Rating Scale) neck pain (cervical spine) and NRS arm pain mJOA (modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association) Score"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of Neck Disability Index (NDI) preoperative (pre-op) compared to 3 month (± 1 month) and 12 months follow-up (± 1 month)","description":"The primary endpoint for this PMCF (Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up) study will be the PROM (Patient-reported Outcome Measurement) instrument Neck Disability Index (NDI).

Subjects randomized to control will also undergo a bone marrow and blood harvest but only receive saline intradiscal injection procedures. Subjects will return to the study site for a visit at Week 2, Week 12, Week 26, Week 52 and Week 104/Early Termination.\n\nThe trial will have a Safety Run-In component that will insert a 3+3 design for the initial subjects dosed with BRTX-100 at 40 × 106 cells. Specifically, the randomization scheme will be briefly shifted from the overall trial 2:1 randomization to an initial 3:1 allotment of intradiscal BRTX-100 versus saline control. As such, four subjects will initially be randomized and administered their agents. There will be a 14 day safety follow-up period that must elapse between dosing of each of the first four (4) subjects. Dosing of each subsequent subject in the Safety Run-In component cannot occur until the independent Medical Monitor (MM) reviews the previously-dosed subject's blinded data, including but not limited to physical examination findings, laboratory values and reported adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), at the completion of the 14-day visit and documents the findings. If no potential dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) is noted by the MM, the MM will approve the dosing of the next subject.

However, even after MIS TLIF, patients still experience issues such as wound or back pain, which can affect their physical activity and increase the risk of infection. Prolonged hospital stays lead to resource wastage.\n\nIn the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) program for spine surgery, preoperative medication, including Acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and Gabapentinoids, is recommended to alleviate postoperative back pain. However, even after implementing ERAS, patients undergoing MIS TLIF still experience pain, suggesting that further pain reduction strategies are needed. The use of Dexamethasone as preemptive medication has shown promising results in various surgeries, with minimal side effects and a manageable cost. Dexamethasone, administered via injection, has a longer duration of action compared to other steroids, making it suitable for preemptive use.\n\nThe main objective is to study the effectiveness of using Dexamethasone via intravenous injection before minimally invasive spine fusion surgery, known as MIS-TLIF, in reducing postoperative back pain.\n\nThe secondary objectives are to compare the rate of morphine usage for pain management after surgery between two groups.\n\nTo compare the side effects and adverse reactions of the medication, such as nausea and vomiting, surgical site infection rates, and blood sugar levels post-surgery.\n\nTo compare the fusion rates of the spinal bones.

The most commonly used surgical treatment for patients with single- or multilevel symptomatic CDDD is anterior cervical discectomy with fusion (ACDF). However, new complaints of radiculopathy and/or myelopathy commonly develop at adjacent levels, also known as clinical adjacent segment pathology (CASP). It remains unknown to what extent kinematics, surgery-induced fusion and natural history of disease play a role in its development. Anterior cervical discectomy with arthroplasty (ACDA) is thought to reduce the incidence of CASP by preserving motion in the operated segment. ACDA is often discouraged as the implant costs are higher whilst the clinical outcomes are similar to ACDF. However, preventing CASP might be a reason for ACDA to be a more cost-effective technique in the long-term.\n\nIn this randomized controlled trial patients will be randomized to receive ACDF or ACDA in a 1:1 ratio. Adult patients with single- or multi-level CDDD and symptoms of radiculopathy and/or myelopathy will be included. The primary outcome is cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of both techniques from a societal perspective. Secondary objectives are the differences in clinical and radiological outcomes between the two techniques, as well as the qualitative process surrounding anterior decompression surgery. All outcomes will be measured at baseline and every 6 months till 4 years postoperatively.\n\nHigh quality evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of both ACDA and ACDF is lacking, to date no prospective trials from a societal perspective exist. Considering the ageing of the population and the rising healthcare costs, the need for a solid clinical cost-effectiveness trial addressing this question is high.","detailedDescription":"Cervical degenerative disc disease (CDDD) is the degeneration of a cervical intervertebral disc and/or the adjoining vertebral bodies, resulting in clinical symptoms of cervical radiculopathy, myelopathy, myeloradiculopathy, and axial pain. The incidence of degenerative pathologies is significantly increasing as the population of elderly is rising. Currently, generalized spinal disc degeneration occurs in more than 90% of adults past the 5th decade of life.This age group now represents 32.8% of the population in Europe and is projected to reach 40.6% by 2050. In the next 20 years a significant increase in anterior cervical decompression surgeries is predicted in those aged 45-54, mainly affecting the working population. Complaints of radiculopathy and/or myelopathy lead to restrictions in daily life and loss of professional capability, resulting in absenteeism. Societal healthcare costs are therefore significantly affected by CDDD. The healthcare costs are driven up further when patients require surgical treatment, in combination with associated hospitalization and rehabilitation. To date, no consensus exists on which anterior surgical technique is more cost-effective to treat CDDD with radiculopathy and/or myelopathy.\n\nOne of the most common procedures for treating patients with single- or multilevel CDDD is anterior cervical discectomy with fusion (ACDF). ACDF results in fusion in 95-100%. The primary goal of ACD(F) is the relief of symptoms of radiculopathy and/or myelopathy through decompression of neural structures. Fusion in itself is not a requisite to reach this goal. In our center, ACDF with stand-alone cages is the standard procedure for CDDD. Plate-constructs are only used on indication. A common concern regarding ACDF with stand-alone cages is the occurrence of cage subsidence. In our retrospective cohort of 673 patients, only 1 patient required additional surgery due to subsidence (0.15%) \\[unpublished data\\]. Axial pain alone is not considered an indication for surgical treatment. Good short-term clinical results are achieved for both radiculopathy and myelopathy. Clinical results are independent from the technique used, and independent from occurrence of fusion. However, patient-reported satisfaction gradually decreases in the years following surgery. This is thought to be the consequence of the development of new complaints due to degenerative changes at a segment adjacent to the site of the index surgery, also known as adjacent segment pathology (ASP).\n\nA recent consensus proposes a distinct definition of radiologic adjacent segment pathology (RASP) and clinical adjacent segment pathology (CASP). CASP occurs at an estimated cumulative rate of 1.6% to 4.2% per year after ACDF, however, a wide variety in incidence is reported in literature. About 50-75% of the patients that develop CASP require additional adjacent segment surgery. In our retrospective cohort, we observed a rate of 2.1% CASP per year, with an additional adjacent segment surgery rate of 1.5% per year. Moreover, we found that half of these patients undergo additional surgery for CASP within 2.5 years, which suggests a peak incidence in the first years following index surgery. The underlying mechanism of ASP remains a matter of debate. Besides natural degeneration, compensation for the loss of motion in the fused segment is thought to cause overstraining of the adjacent segments. Altered cervical sagittal alignment is also thought to be of importance in the accelerated development of CASP. Higher rates of CASP are observed after ACD, concomitant with an increased segmental kyphosis at the index level. Unlike ACD, ACDF with plate-constructs restore cervical sagittal lordosis. However, a higher rate of ASP is observed in those with plate-constructs in comparison to ACDF with stand-alone cages. The higher rate of ASP after ACDF with plate-constructs might be explained by strain on the adjacent segments by the plate, or more extensive surgical preparation for installing the plate increasing the chance on destruction of the adjacent level. Another contributing factor might be the occurrence of subsidence of the plate-construct into the adjacent segment. Disc height at the adjacent segments is found to be significantly decreased in those with plate-constructs, which supports this theory. It remains unknown to what extent altered cervical motion influences the development of ASP.\n\nAnterior cervical discectomy with arthroplasty (ACDA) was developed to reduce the incidence of CASP by preserving motion in the operated segment. Previously conducted research in patients with radiculopathy and/or myelopathy has shown no significant differences in clinical or radiological outcomes amongst ACDA and ACD(F). A meta-analysis found better neurological outcomes in patients with myelopathy after ACDA, in contrast to the pre-existing notion that ACDA leads to less favorable outcomes in myelopathy due to micro-trauma caused by preserved mobility. Moreover, additional adjacent segment surgery rates are significantly lower for ACDA, both for single- and multilevel surgeries. The difference in additional adjacent segment surgery rates between ACDA and ACDF expands exponentially with a longer-follow-up time. ACDA is often discouraged as the implant costs are higher than those for ACDF whilst clinical outcomes are similar. However, preventing new complaints and additional surgeries due to CASP might be a reason for ACDA to be a more cost-effective technique in the long-term. A systematic review of economic evaluations in anterior cervical decompression surgery was conducted by our research group. The majority of studies report ACDA to be the most cost-effective technique despite higher implant costs. Literature was however strongly heterogeneous and of low quality.\n\nIn conclusion, there is increasing evidence suggesting that ACDA might be the more cost-effective technique because of a reduced risk on CASP and associated additional surgery rates, compared to ACD(F). High quality evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of both ACDA and ACDF is lacking, especially in Europe. Therefore, the need for a solid clinical cost-effectiveness trial addressing this question is high."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Radiculopathy, Cervical","Myelopathy Cervical","Myelopathy, Compressive","Radiculopathy, Cervical Region","Radiculopathy; in Spondylosis","Radiculopathy; in Intervertebral Disc Disorder","Myelopathy Neurological","Myelopathy Due to Spondylosis","Cervical Disc Disease","Cervical Disc Herniation","Cervical Disc Degeneration","Cervical Disc Disorder With Myelopathy","Cervical Disc Prolapse With Myelopathy","Cervical Spondylosis","Cervical Fusion","Cervical Disc Disorder With Radiculopathy","Cervical Disc Prolapse With Radiculopathy","Fusion of Spine","Disc Prolapse Cervical"],"keywords":["Cost-effectivity","Economic evaluation","Health Utility","Randomised controlled trial","RCT","ACDA","ACDF","Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion","Anterior cervical discectomy with arthroplasty","Degenerative cervical myelopathy","Degenerative cervical radiculopathy","ASD","Adjacent Segment Disease","Adjacent Level Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Prospective Single-blind Randomised Controlled Trial with computer randomization in a 1:1 ratio","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Participants will be blinded until one-year after allocation.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":198,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ACDF","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion.","interventionNames":["Procedure: ACDF"]},{"label":"ACDA","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Anterior cervical discectomy with arthroplasty.","interventionNames":["Procedure: ACDA"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"ACDF","description":"Standard operative treatment for anterior cervical discectomy.

As such, the decision for- and optimal timing of surgery remain challenging.\n\nCurrently, the decision for surgery in patients with symptomatic CDDD is related to symptoms, as well as position and size of disc herniation on conventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, conventional MRI only enables qualitative morphological evaluation, leaving space for subjective individual interpretation. Also, disc herniations on conventional MRI are frequently found in asymptomatic individuals, while, in symptomatic individuals type and extent of disc herniation does not correlate to severity of symptoms. Altogether, the current standard using conventional MRI cannot optimally predict response to surgery for patients with symptomatic CDDD.\n\nQuantitative imaging is rapidly being recognized as a supplement to conventional MRI and refers to the direct measurement of physical properties of tissue. These novel techniques are promising, as they are noninvasive and could potentially aid in determining objective cut-offs to stage disc herniation. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is one of the most studied quantitative techniques and allows for evaluation of microstructural changes. The DTI fractional anisotropy (FA) metric was demonstrated as valid biomarker for recovery after surgery in cervical myelopathy as well as surgical selection in lumbar radiculopathy. Moreover, recent introduction of zoomed-DTI (z-DTI) could lead to greater imaging accuracy while proven feasible in the cervical spine.\n\nFurthermore, the cervical spinal cord and its nerve roots are highly vascularized and their perfusion could be compromised by disc-herniation related compression. Using the endogenous perfusion technique arterial spin labeling (ASL), as well as contrast-based perfusion techniques such as susceptibility contrast (DSC) and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE), degree of ischemia, hypoxia as well as signal enhancement can be estimated. ASL has been studied twice for spinal cord perfusion mapping and DSC was demonstrated feasible in the spine of healthy participants as well as patients with cervical myelopathy. Additionally, increased signal enhancement was observed for DCE in degenerative discs of the lumbar spine. To our best knowledge, no studies have been conducted to assess perfusion of the cervical nerve roots, which are compromised in cervical radiculopathy due to CDDD.\n\nBesides microstructure and perfusion, viscoelastic properties of cervical spinal structures may change in relation to disc herniation-related compression. Therefore, it would be interesting to study mechanical properties such as stiffness and viscosity, which can be measured with Tomo-MRElastography (TMRE). To our best knowledge, no previous study has assessed cervical intervertebral discs and spinal structures using TMRE, making this a promising first study.\n\nFinally, imaging is a relatively time-consuming matter, and including additional sequences will only increase its lengthiness. Therefore, several methods are being developed to perform imaging in a more efficient manner. One novel method is Synthetic MRI (SyMRI). Advantages of SyMRI are a reduced acquisition time, possibility of performing automatic tissue segmentation and volume estimation and acquisition of quantitative parameters. SyMRI has been studied once in the spine, and significant differences in quantitative intervertebral disc values were found in relation to hydration-status of the disc.\n\nSince no single measurement has been proven to be the golden standard in previous studies, it is likely that a combination of measurements is needed for clinical application. Therefore, the aim of this pilot study is to explore a multi-parametric quantitative MRI approach including z-DTI, ASL, DSC, DCE, TMRE, and SyMRI to measure cervical intervertebral discs, the spinal cord and its nerve roots.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\n\nThis study will consist of three parts. The primary objective of part 1 is to evaluate feasibility of the quantitative MRI sequences (e.g. z-DTI, ASL, DSC, DCE, TMRE, and SyMRI) for assessment of cervical spinal structures (e.g. intervertebral discs, spinal cord, and nerve roots) in healthy participants and patients with symptomatic CDDD. The primary objective of part 2 is to determine a correlation between the quantitative MRI sequences of cervical spinal structures to clinical outcome in patients with symptomatic CDDD. Finally, the primary aim of part 3 is to establish a correlation between quantitative MRI sequences of cervical spinal structures and surgical treatment within 6 months of follow-up.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN:\n\nA prospective pilot study.\n\nSTUDY POPULATION:\n\nThe study population consists of healthy participants and patients with symptomatic CDDD with radiculopathy, myelopathy, or radiculomyelopathy. Age-matched healthy participants will be included. Participants have no previous history of cervical disc herniation or cervical surgery, a sufficient understanding of the Dutch language and no contraindications for an MRI scan.\n\nINTERVENTION:\n\nAll participants will be subjected to several MRI sequences, using a state of the art 3T Siemens MRI Scanner available in the UMCG. First, all participants (healthy participants and patients with symptomatic CDDD) undergo baseline neurologic examination. Additionally, participants fill out the following questionnaires: Neck Disability Index (NDI), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for arm and neck pain, modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA), Nurick grade, EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L), Work Ability Single Item (WAI-SI), and Central Sensitisation Inventory (CSI). All participants undergo MRI scanning: localizer \\& T2-weighted anatomical (conventional MRI), z-DTI, ASL, DSC, DCE, TMRE, and SyMR. The total scanning time will be approximately 40 minutes. For assessment of reproducibility, 10 healthy participants and 10 patients will be scanned 2 times on different days/times. The patients with symptomatic CDDD will have another study visit after 6 months of follow-up to assess their treatment status (having had surgery yes/no; in case of yes also the surgery characteristics), to fill out the abovementioned questionnaires and have an MRI with additional sequences.\n\nMAIN STUDY PARAMETERS/ENDPOINTS:\n\nPrimary endpoints are the technical feasibility and repeatability for the quantitative MRI sequences (i.e. z_DTI, ASL, DSC, DCE, TMRE, and SyMRI) of cervical spinal structures (i.e. intervertebral discs, spinal cord, and nerve roots) in healthy participants and patients with symptomatic CDDD. Also, a correlation of quantitative MRI sequences of cervical spinal structures to clinical impairment in patients with symptomatic CDDD will be determined. Clinical impairment will be measured with the Neck Disability Index (NDI) for cervical radiculopathy, modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association Score (mJOA) for cervical myelopathy, and NDI as well as mJOA for radiculomyelopathy.\n\nNATURE AND EXTENT OF THE BURDER AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PARTICIPATION, BENEFIT AND GROUP RELATEDNESS:\n\nAll participants (healthy and patients) will need a conventional MRI scan with quantitative MRI sequences, which will take approximately 40 minutes. Most MRI sequences used in this study are noninvasive and do not involve any ionizing radiation. However, DSC and DCE require administration of a bolus contrast. The contrast agent that will be used is Dotarem. Without any contra-indications for an MRI scan or contrast agent, health is not at risk. There is an overall negligible risk for participants, as based on the Risk Classification Checklist of the NFU. Therefore, the investigators can conclude that this study is a low-risk study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cervical Radiculopathy","Cervical Myelopathy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Healthy participants","interventionNames":["Device: Quantitative MRI and anatomical MRI"]},{"label":"Patients with CDDD","interventionNames":["Device: Quantitative MRI and anatomical MRI"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Quantitative MRI and anatomical MRI","description":"The total scanning time will be approximately 40 minutes.

The study is prospective, with outcome measures being obtained at numerous time points after the regenerative procedure.","detailedDescription":"Medical providers are often faced with patients whose source of pain may be the result of an inflammatory response caused by trauma or disease. By managing the patient's inflammation, the clinician may see improved response to traditional pain management therapy and existing protocols.\n\nAlso, degenerative arthritis of spinal and extremity joints may lead to significant low back, knee, hip, shoulder pain etc, as the ratio of cartilage degradation to cartilage formation increases with age. An amniotic tissue derived product may prove to be an ideal non-steroidal and potentially regenerative therapy for use by the medical provider due to its unique characteristics.\n\nThe orthopedic application of amniotic fluid dates back to at least the 1930's. The placental membranes produce an array of immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory molecules, which make these tissues suitable for use as a wound covering \\[or as an anti-inflammatory\\] in a clinical setting. In addition to structural properties, placental membrane and amniotic fluid (AF) is a rich source of growth factors, including organic compounds and nutrients, hyaluronic acids, amino acids, antioxidants and stem cells.\n\nAF's anti-inflammatory actions may be mediated in part by its secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-10, inhibin, activin, and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist as well as anti-inflammatory protease inhibitors such as ∞-1 anti-trypsin inhibitor and inter-a-trypsin inhibitor. AF may modulate acquired immunity by suppressing alloreactive responses and down regulating production of Th1 and Th2 cytokines.\n\nIn addition to having known anti-inflammatory qualities, placental membrane cells, derived from the layer of trophoblast cells covering the developing embryo, do not express MHC Class II antigens, which are responsible for the rapid rejection of allografts in humans. Because AF is immune privileged, it is an ideal allograft with no known graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).\n\nThe amniotic fluid product may provide not only an anti-inflammatory response, but also potentially yield regenerative effect or reduce further cartilage degeneration.\n\nThe objective of this study is to evaluate an amniotic fluid tissue product in the treatment of pain due to all types of musculoskeletal conditions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Osteoarthritis","Tendinitis","Sports Injury","Degenerative Disc Disease","Degenerative Arthritis","Ligament Injury","Neuropathy","Pelvic Pain"],"keywords":["regenerative medicine","arthritis","amniotic","stem cell","growth factor","cartilage"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Umbilical Allograft","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The study is nonrandomized with one arm.

Reducing the need for opiate analgesics in the post-operative setting has become a high priority in minimizing long-term opioid use in surgical patients. This study will serve to demonstrate the efficacy of the addition of regional analgesic techniques in reducing post-operative opioid requirements in patients undergoing common lumbar spinal surgical procedures.","detailedDescription":"Opioid abuse and misuse remain a public health crisis in the United States, notably in patients with chronic pain from degenerative spine disease. Perioperative pain management for patients undergoing spinal surgery remains largely reliant on opioid medications, with several known adverse effects including, but not limited to delirium, postoperative urinary retention (POUR), constipation and nausea. These side effects contribute to increased hospital length of stay (LOS) with increased incidence of overall in-hospital complications, perioperative costs, and increased rates of opioid habituation and addiction.\n\nDependence on prescription opioids has been associated with wide-ranging social and economic consequences including increased opioid overdose resulting in death, growing opioid-related incarcerations, and spiraling opioid-related healthcare cost from treatment of addiction, opioid-related mental health issues, and debilitating chronic pain. Long-term requirements for opioid medications may be associated with the use of higher doses of opioids in the perioperative period for patients undergoing invasive surgery for spinal degenerative conditions. Studies have demonstrated that patients who consume fewer opioids for 30 days after surgery are less likely to progress to become chronic opioid users. Regional analgesic techniques have shown promise in decreasing post-operative pain and opioid requirements in thoracic and abdominal surgery but difficulties with post-operative neurological assessments have limited their use in spinal surgery. Inter-fascial plane blocks, however, have emerged as a safe and potentially useful regional analgesic technique to mitigate the pain-inducing effects of posterior spine surgery.\n\nErector Spinae Plane Blocks (ESPBs), specifically, involve ultra-sound guided injection of local anesthetic (LA) posteriorly beneath the erector spinae muscles resulting in longitudinal and ventrolateral spread of the anesthetic into the paravertebral space where the ventral and dorsal rami of the spinal nerves are located thereby inducing a multi-level analgesic effect. Depending upon the LA used, this effect may last for 4 to 36 hours.\n\nThe proposed study will examine the efficacy of preoperative ESPBs in reducing post-operative opioid utilization and its associated complications specifically after minimally invasive (MIS) lumbar spine surgery including both decompressive and instrumented fusion procedures. The guiding principle of MIS spine surgery is reduction of iatrogenic injury by utilizing muscle dilating approaches and tubular retractors rather than conventional open, subperiosteal muscle stripping techniques. The latter typically results in muscle denervation and devascularization as well as postoperative muscle atrophy and dead space creation that increase postoperative pain, muscle dysfunction, prolonged recovery times and complications. Since MIS spinal surgical procedures preserve normal paraspinal musculature compared to open surgery, the magnitude of effect of ESPBs may actually be more pronounced in this population.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that by conducting this investigation within the rigor of a double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, the results will definitively demonstrate that the addition of regional analgesia in the form of ESPB during MIS lumbar spine surgery will 1) reduce post-operative opioid consumption and 2) reduce opioid-related complications and hospital LOS but 3) have no adverse effects on postoperative pain control."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lumbar Spinal Stenosis","Lumbar Disc Herniation","Lumbar Spondylolisthesis","Lumbar Spondylosis","Lumbar Radiculopathy","Lumbar Spine Instability","Synovial Cyst","Degenerative Disc Disease","Degenerative Spondylolisthesis","Degenerative Intervertebral Discs"],"keywords":["erector spinae plane block","minimally invasive spine surgery","regional anesthesia","randomized controlled trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"All patients will undergo surgery using an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) multi-modal anesthesia protocol that is currently in standard use for MIS lumbar spine surgical procedures.

It is dominantly caused by degenerative changes, while specific causes such as tumor, trauma or inflammatory conditions are relatively rare. Back pain may be a concomitant symptom of lumbar disc herniation or spinal canal stenosis and is a typical symptom of spondylolisthesis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a key role in the diagnosis, showing in detail the soft structures, vertebral bodies (Modic changes, MC) or signs of facet arthropathy. On the other hand, it also proves a number of clinically silent findings. Degenerative disc disease (DDD) or facet osteoarthritis are most often considered to be a pain generator. The problem, however, is that both entities are very common in the general population without a painful correlate, and there is still controversy in the literature about their role in the genesis of CBP.\n\nRadionuclide bone scintigraphy with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provides functional imaging and is used to detect microcalcification due to increased osteoblastic activity. In the absence of other pathology the foci of increased osteoblastic activity reflex areas of mechanical stress and degenerative change in the skeleton. There is growing evidence about the relationship between DDD, facet arthropathy, and SPECT positivity. Although these findings have been recently confirmed by surgical studies, the evidence about the effect of surgical treatment of SPECT positive lumbar degeneration is still weak due to the small number of operated patients.\n\nThe aim of the present study is to define a possible correlation between degenerative changes of the lumbar spine and positivity on SPECT/CT imaging. Patients with multilevel SPECT+ DDD or facet arthropathy will undergo spinal fusion of the involved segments. Postoperative improvement will be measured by ODI (Oswestry Disability Index) and pain VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) in 6 and 24 months follow-up period."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Degenerative Disc Disease","Back Pain Lower Back Chronic","Facet Joint Arthropathy","Facet Syndrome of Lumbar Spine"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Lumbar fusion","description":"Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion of the SPECT/CT positive lumbar degeneration"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)","description":"The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is an index derived from the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire.

This study also aims to perform a radiological analysis of MRI scans before and after treatment to optimize patient selection and surgical strategies. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does FELD provide superior early postoperative pain relief (measured by VAS) compared to MD?\n* Does FELD offer better functional recovery (measured by COMI and ODI scores) postoperatively compared to MD?\n* Can radiological analysis of pre- and post-operative MRI images help optimize patient qualification and guide surgical strategies?\n\nResearchers will compare patients undergoing FELD to those undergoing MD to see if endoscopic techniques result in faster recovery and lower early postoperative pain while maintaining similar long-term outcomes. The study will also analyze how MRI findings correlate with clinical outcomes to refine operative decision-making.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Undergo either FELD or MD surgery\n* Complete VAS, COMI, and ODI questionnaires at pre-specified follow-up intervals (1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-surgery)\n* Have MRI scans 24 hours before surgery, 24 hours after surgery, and at each follow-up to assess disc recurrence, residual pathology, and to optimize surgical strategies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lumbar Degenerative Disease","Lumbar Radiculopathy","Sciatic Leg Pain","Sciatic Nerve Compression","Discopathy","Disc Herniation","Disc Herniation with Radiculopathy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":220,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"TELD","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Transforaminal endoscopic lumbar discectomy","interventionNames":["Procedure: transforaminal endoscopic lumbar discectomy"]},{"label":"IELD","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Interlaminar endoscopic lumbar discectomy","interventionNames":["Procedure: Interlaminar endoscopic lumbar discectomy"]},{"label":"MD","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"microdiscectomy","interventionNames":["Procedure: Microdiscectomy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"transforaminal endoscopic lumbar discectomy","description":"FELD is a minimally invasive spine surgery technique performed through small incisions using an endoscope.

LBP is one of the highest incidence medical conditions that contributes to disability, decreased activities of daily living, decreased quality of life, and inability to work. LBP affects ≈70-85% of people during their lifetime, with ≈20% becoming chronic by age 20-59 years. Many current LBP therapeutics have detrimental long-term effects, undesired side effects, are invasive procedures with low success rates, and do not fare better than conservative care. Further, many chronic musculoskeletal pain patients do not respond to surgery, and many develop dependence on opioids.\n\nThis project will implement a small-scale double-blinded, randomized proof-of-concept clinical trial to gather biomechanical and MRI data that will objectively determine the effectiveness of non-surgical spinal decompression (NSSD) over a 12-week longitudinal timeframe. The potential to provide a non-invasive alternative to chronic LBP via NSSD is innovative and addresses the pressing need for safer, more effective pain management options with fewer negative sequelae. NSSD has the potential to greatly improve lives, offering a new paradigm for chronic pain management.","detailedDescription":"Participants who consent to the study will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment.\n\nBaseline: During this visit, the patient will receive a chiropractic physician examination that will include reflexes, myotome, dermatome, and orthopedic assessments. If the examination provides evidence of an intervertebral disc pathology and/or sciatica, the patient will be referred to an MRI assessment to confirm diagnosis for standard of care. Based on these assessments, the research team will determine if the participant meets the initial criteria to continue with participation.\n\nRandomization: Participants will be randomized to either non-surgical spinal decompression (20 treatments) or placebo (20 treatments). Participants will not be able to choose the treatment. The participant nor the investigators will know which treatment you are receiving. If a participant receives the placebo treatment, once they are unblinded, they will be able to receive non-surgical spinal decompression should they elect to do so.\n\nPre-intervention Assessments: Assessments prior to intervention will include 1) 3D motion capture performing functional tasks, 2) electromyography of the lower back and legs, 3) myotonometer tonometry, 4) range of motion, and 5) Sensorimotor reflex measurement. In addition, the participant will complete online questionnaires that include the Defense Veterans Pain Rating Scale 2.0, PROMIS Pain Interference, PROMIS Physical Function, Central Sensitization Inventory, and the Oswestry Disability Index.\n\nPost-intervention Assessments: Assessments after intervention will include 1) 3D motion capture performing functional tasks, 2) electromyography of the lower back and legs, 3) myotonometer tonometry, 4) range of motion, and 5) Sensorimotor reflex measurement.

The well-accepted strategy for prevention and treatment of diabetic eye complications focused on confirmed diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, cataract, etc, and there was no definitive therapy for preclinical central visual acuity (CVA) impairment, mainly because of its unknown pathogenesis. In our previous population-based study, the prevalence rate of early CVA impairment was as high as 9.1%, and that obviously limits the effects of diabetic eye diseases prevention and early-stage treatment strategy. Of note, the choriocapillaris is the only route for metabolic exchange in the retina within the foveal avascular zone, it was speculated that early CVA impairment is related to diabetic choroidopathy (DC). Recent research shows that the decreased macular choriocapillaris vessel density (MCVD) in diabetic eye ,which indicating early ischemia, is already present before diabetic macular edema can be observed; we have observed subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) decreased significantly in the early CVA impairment patients. However, up til now, there was no epidemiology report on early CVA impairment in Chinese diabetes population. In the present study, we plan to conduct a 10-year perspective cohort observation of 2217 Chinese type 2 diabetic residents without diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, cataract and other vision impairing diseases, trying to find out related physical and biochemical risk factors. The results will facilitate discriminating high risk groups of early CVA impairment in diabetic patients. In the same time, a quantitative relationship between SFCT change, MCVD change and CVA change will be established. This study will demonstrate the role of DC in the occurrence of preclinical CVA impairment, and provide important theoretic evidence of blocking agents which target on DC."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetic Retinopathy","Visual Impairment","Diabetic Maculopathy"],"keywords":["Type 2 diabetes mellitus","diabetic retinopathy","visual impairment","diabetic choroidopathy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"10 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Blood"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Diabetic retinopathy cohort"},{"label":"Mild visual impairment cohort"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Diabetic retinopathy","description":"The DR grades are according to the well-accepted ''International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy and Diabetic Macular Edema Disease Severity Scale''","timeFrame":"December 31，2024"},{"measure":"mild visual impairment","description":"Mild visual impairment was present if BCVA was \\< 20/25 but ≥ 20/63.","timeFrame":"December 31，2024"},{"measure":"macular choriocapillaris vessel density(MCVD)","description":"macular choriocapillaris vessel density","timeFrame":"December 31，2024"},{"measure":"glycosylated hemoglobin","description":"This test measures the average blood sugar control for the previous three months or so.","timeFrame":"December 31，2024"},{"measure":"retinal thickness (RT)","description":"Retinal thickness was defined as the distance from the internal limiting membrane to the interface of the photoreceptor outer segments and retinal pigment epithelium.","timeFrame":"December 31，2024"},{"measure":"choroidal thickness (CT)","description":"Choroidal thickness was measured from the outer border of the RPE to the inner border of the choroidoscleral interface.","timeFrame":"December 31，2024"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* ≥18 years old;\n* Diabetes mellitus (DM) was defined as either blood hemoglobin A1C≥6.5%, use of diabetic medication or a physician diagnosis of diabetes.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* None;","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
